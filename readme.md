- v0.1
  -  Fix duplicate default keybind for Science and Relay
     -  `F5` to switch to the Science station
     -  `F6` to switch to the Relay station
-  v0.2
   -  Use Arrow Keys to move Engineering Crew
      -  Avoids keybinding collision in Engineering+, where S moves the Crew down, but also toggles Shields

      -  Requires EE greater than Version 20230617 as `-` cannot be read as a keybind due to a SeriousProton bug
