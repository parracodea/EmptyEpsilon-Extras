1. Copy `keybindings.json` and `options.ini`  to your EmptyEpsilon folder. 
    - Alternatively, edit the following in your `options.ini`:
        ```ini
        # options.ini

        mod=parracodea-vanilla-tweaks
        ```
2. In your `resources` folder, create a `mods` folder.
3. Copy this folder to the `mods` folder. Your folders should look something like this. Not all files are shown.
